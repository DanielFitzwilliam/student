## Level 4 Summary
For this level 4, I had the idea to make it themed after the sky levels from mario. These levels have fluffy cloud backgrounds and are filled with bullet enemies. The first thing I did was add another level for the new assets to go in. I then added a cloud background. Next, I created a new JS file called Bullet.js. I created a class called Bullet which extends Character. Once the bullat had data like an image, hitbox size, and speedRatio, I could work on its unique properties. I added a sprite for the bullets then made them move downwards from the top of the screen. Next, I made them reset back to the top of the screen once they reach the bottom. This created a loop of bullets shooting down that Mario has to dodge. Overall I am very happy with the way the level turned out, the bullets are a unique challenge and the cloud background changes the look of the level a lot. I even made the bullets freeze when the random event that freezes the goombas is chosen.
