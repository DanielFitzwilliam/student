# Our Team
Our team is Me, Xaiver, Justin, Abigail, and Timur.
We worked on several features: the enemies, coins, platforms, and item block. I believe that the features we added are a big, very noticeable part of the gameplay of the project. Our contributions are very tangible things in the game world that players are likely to notice, so I am happy that we managed to make all of the different interactions work without too many bugs. I think our biggest strength as a team is that we all had many different features and took on a large workload for the class. I think our biggest weakness as a group is communication. Everyone in the group worked pretty independently on different aspects of the game, which meant that our code did not have very much standardization. This is especially true when working with several groups that for the most part stayed apart. I think if I was to take this class again I would want to make sure that everyone communicates the specifics more so everyone's code feels like it is a part of the same project. I felt proud of my accomplishment at the Night at the Museum event and felt oblogated to advertise our class to other students and parents.

# Other Teams
There were some pretty cool projects at Night at the Museum. For computer science, I was especially impressed with the login systems showcased by several groups. A way to login to a website is a very practical and commonplace application for code, and I was surprised at how professional the UI looked. Outside of computer science, I took the opportunity to check out the photography room. Once again, all of the work looked extremely professional. The photos they had showcased looked like they could have been for a stock library or a default homescreen, which in my opinion is the pinnacle of high-quality photography that I see in my everyday life.
