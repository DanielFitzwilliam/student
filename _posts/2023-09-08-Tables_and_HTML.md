# 9/8/23 - Tables and HTML
September 8, 2023: This is the second post for my blog for my class Computer Science and Software Engineering 1.

### Retrun to Routine
Now week 3 is underway and I've finally gotten back into my normal daily routine for the school year. I've started to identify which classes are going to be easy or hard. To a good student is managing time my limited time for homework well and knowing what my priorities are. A strategy for this is to kill two birds with one stone, and since I have to make a table for computer science anyways...

| Class | Period | Effort | Difficulty | Homework | Total |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| Engineering | 1 | 4/10 | 18/20 | 3/10 | 25/40 |
| AP Calculus AB | 2 | 2/10 | 15/20 | 10/10 | 27/40 |
| Spanish 4 | 3 | 1/10 | 4/20 | 1/10 | 6/40 |
| Computer Science and Software Engineering 1 | 4 | 10/10 | 16/20 | 5/10 | 31/40 |
| High School English 3 | 5 | 8/10 | 10/20 | 4/10 | 22/40 |

### This Week in my Life
This week's Monday is Labor Day, which always a nice break. I competed in anpther cross country meet last Saturday, my first 3-mile race. I got 18th and a PR of 17:43. I'm pretty stressed about a couple of my classes, mainly CSSE and Engineering. However, I do have a couple of plans for how I am going to manage them.

### Top Secret Future Plans
Continuing with a theme of being more organized, I have decided to create some specefic and complete plans for the next two days.

Thursday (today):
- Finish this week's blog
- Review the checklist for tomorrow's pair showcase
- Practice using Jupyter Notebooks by making an html table

Friday
- Pair showcase w/ Mr. M
- Look ahead to next week's goals and concieve a detailed plan for the next week so I can stay organized.
- Finalize the blog
