The code itself was structurally sound, the thing that needd to be changed though was how the results were being logged in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of console.log need to output the letter. To do this we use alphabet[i-1]. Basically this means once i equals the letterNumber it will then print the current letter it’s on. The reason why we subtract by 1 and go back a number is because javascript starts counting at 0, while we start counting the alphabets by 1. Next we concatenate the rest of the sentence together so we can add both strings and variables."
